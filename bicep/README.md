# Bicep Practice: Virtual Machine + NSG

This folder contains a basic example of deploying a virtual machine and network security group using Bicep as part of my AZ-305 study.

## Objective

To understand how to define Azure infrastructure using declarative syntax and practice modular deployment using Bicep.

## Files

- `main.bicep`: Core deployment script
- `parameters.json`: Parameter input file (optional)

## Notes

- This is a simplified version for learning purposes.
- Further modularization or automation (via pipelines) is a future step.
